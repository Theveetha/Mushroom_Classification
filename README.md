_EdiFungi: ML model to safeguard foragers by distinguishing poisonous from edible mushroom_

## **Introduction:**
1. Mushrooms are a diverse group of fungi which is extensively used in many cuisines.
2. A unique challenge that we have here is distinguishing between edible and poisonous varieties due to their varied characteristics.
3. This classification or identification plays a crucial role in ensuring food safety and preventing the consumption of toxic or poisonous varieties.

## **Objective:**
1. Our fundamental goal is to create a model that can properly classify mushrooms as either edible or harmful based on their attributes using machine learning.
2. This is required to prevent accidental poisoning and promoting safe intake of mushrooms.
3. This also helps mushroom foragers to make an informed decision during mushroom foraging, ultimately ensuring their safety and well being.

## **Analysis Method:**
1. Given that the mushroom in the dataset is either classified as ‘edible’/ ‘poisonous’, this is a binary classification problem.
2. Proposed methodology to approach this problem
